    fullDescription: `Hi, I’m Kobi Ampem Afriyie, a passionate computer engineering student at KNUST and a bold believer in the power of technology to transform lives and communities.\nFrom leading my high school as SRC President, STEM Club President, and Robotics Team Captain, to representing Ghana in national and international competitions, I’ve always seen leadership and innovation as tools for impact. Today, I channel that same energy into building solutions in AI/ML, IoT, Robotics, and Backend Development , fields I’m actively exploring with hands-on projects and community initiatives.\n\nI’m a proud recipient of the Francis Faki Amanquah Foundation Scholarship, a robotics instructor, and currently serve as general secretary of Women in Engineering-KNUST, Community Manager at EasyCode Foundation, and team lead for Ananse AI's Intelidiag.\n\nWith skills in Python, C programming, robotics, and public speaking, I aim to blend engineering, empathy, and leadership to build scalable tech that solves real problems, starting from my community in Ghana.\nI’m especially passionate about mentoring girls in STEM, optimizing systems with code, and learning everything I can about robots, AI, and emerging technologies.\n\nLet’s connect and build the future together.`,
